# Introduction and motivation

[FILL] Give the bigger picture of the data, and inspire the reader to learn more about the problem by reading your analysis. 

# Data description
The data source is from The Smithsonian Institution (volcano.si.edu), which has been constantly updating since 2013. The data was made available for download on (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-05-12/readme.md), so that we directly import the 5 data sets for this analysis. These 5 data sets are volcano, eruptions, events, tree_rings and sulfur, allowing us to discover the influences among them. 

- `volcano` data set consists of 26 variables, encompassing the location, geological and population information of the 958 volcanoes recorded. For variables "last_eruption_year", "major_rock" and "minor_rock", some cells are labelled as "unknown" or leave as blank for cases where data is unknown or unrecorded.

# Analysis and findings
